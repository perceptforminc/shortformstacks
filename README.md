# Short Form Stacks

Imagine Twitter, but for Stacks! 

Like many of us in the world of crypto, I find myself on Twitter often yet I wonder what Twitter would be like if it were decentralized. 

As a publically traded VC backed company, I have doubts that the platform we all love to use will ever by decentrailzed but I then began to ask myself why we love it. 

We love it for the memes. The news. Trending topics. But one big reason why we love it because the world can see our thouughts. What would happen if Twitter went on the blockchain as a public diary? 

Sign in with your Hiro or XVerse wallet. 
Write a thought.
Pay a small fee to scribe it into history like Stacks did with this Satoshi quote within the Genesis Block of Stacks.

This public diary would have read only functions so anyone could view it (with a front end developed which can happen if demand is there). 

To post, all youu need is a Hiro or XVerse wallet and STX in your wallet, which could be purchased from an exchange like OKCoin.
