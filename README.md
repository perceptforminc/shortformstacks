## **Short Form Stacks**

Imagine Twitter, but for Stacks! 

Like many of us in the world of crypto, I find myself on Twitter often yet I wonder what Twitter would be like if it were decentralized. 

As a publicly-traded VC-backed company, I have doubts that the platform we all love to use will ever be decentralized but I then began to ask myself why we love it. 

We love it for the memes. The news. Trending topics. But one big reason why we love it is that the world can see our thoughts. What would happen if Twitter went on the blockchain as a public diary? 

- Sign in with your Hiro or XVerse wallet. 
- Write a thought.
- Pay a small fee to scribe it into history, as Stacks did with this Satoshi quote within the Genesis Block of Stacks.

Imagine proposals on the Stacks blockchain. Yearbook comments. Final statements from people in hospice. People doing gender reveals through blockchain statements on Stacks. Instead of cards from Hallmark, people make their mark by creating short-form statements on the Stacks blockchain. This is the vision. 

If a front end was developed for Short Form Stacks, all a user would need is a Hiro or XVerse wallet and STX in your wallet, which could be purchased from an exchange like OKCoin. 

(Fun Fact: Internally, Short Form Stacks is also known as Statements on Stacks.)

Thank you Stacks for the opportunity to submit for the Clarity Cohort 2 Hackathon!
